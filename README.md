# LuluCSS

A simple, small but responsive CSS framework based on an em-grid. Sizes are generally relative to the user's
selected font-size. LuluCSS does not override the user's font settings because we believe this is a bad thing to do.
If you use LuluCSS *please* adhere to our/my philosophy of not messing with the user's font settings.
