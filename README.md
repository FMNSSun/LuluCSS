# LuluCSS

A simple, small but responsive CSS framework based on an em-grid. Sizes are generally relative to the user's
selected font-size. LuluCSS does not override the user's font settings because we believe this is a bad thing to do.
If you use LuluCSS *please* adhere to our/my philosophy of not messing with the user's font settings. 

## Notice

Please be aware that this is a work in progress and currently you should consider it as a public alpha.
Nevertheless, you are free to use it (CC-BY-SA 4.0) and provide feedback. 

## Goals

* Simple CSS framework
* Fits into less than 12kB _readable_ CSS. 
* Responsive without JS.
* Based on _em_.

## Bug reports and Feature Whishes
